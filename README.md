# texas-holdem-simulator
This is a Python implementation of a Texas Hold'em Monte Carlo Simulator.

Currently, this only simulates heads-up poker. May consider creating option to add more players in the future.

To play, type `python simulator.py --iterations 5000 --your_cards AhAd`

Of course, you can change the number of iterations, as well as the cards in your hand.
